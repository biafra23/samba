# Blockchain Protocol Intern – Samba

**Location:** Remote  
**Project:** Samba   
**Type:** Internship (Part-time or Full-time)

---

## About the Project

**Samba** is a Java-based implementation of a Portal client for Ethereum following the Portal Network specifications. It is designed around a modular, flexible architecture that enables lightweight, decentralized access to Ethereum data, starting with full support for the History sub-network. Samba has passed all Hive tests for the History network and is built on a foundation of proven libraries including Discv5, a custom uTP transport implementation, and reusable components from both Teku and Besu, ensuring robustness and compatibility with the broader Ethereum infrastructure.

We are currently advancing through multi-stage implementations to complete full support for the **State** and **Beacon** sub-networks, aligned with Ethereum's scalability roadmap.

---

## Internship Role Overview

We’re seeking a **Blockchain Protocol Intern** to support the development, testing, and validation of Portal sub-network features in **Java**. You’ll collaborate with core developers in building verifiable data structures, handling SSZ serialization, implementing and testing network protocols, and extending the Samba client.

## Responsibilities

Depending on your background and stage of the roadmap, responsibilities may include:

- Implement and test sub-network-specific features for History, State, and Beacon networks in Samba.
- Assist in developing serialization and deserialization logic for SSZ-based data types.
- Write and maintain content validation logic and merkle proofs.
- Contribute to the integration of Samba as a plugin within Besu.
- Run and monitor Docker containers hosting Samba instances across test and dev environments.
- Configure and maintain basic CI/CD workflows (e.g., GitHub Actions) to automate testing and deployment.
- Write developer-focused documentation for Samba’s APIs, test strategies, and networking architecture.
- Participate in debugging, code reviews, and weekly team syncs.
- Collaborate with open-source maintainers and contribute to cross-client Ethereum test suites (Hive).

---

## Requirements

- Solid understanding of Java or other JVM-based languages.
- Willingness to dive into Ethereum protocol specs.
- Some familiarity with **Ethereum**, **Merkle proofs**, **networking**, or **SSZ** is highly desirable.
- Comfort reading and referencing [Ethereum Consensus Specs](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/) or [Portal Network Docs](https://github.com/ethereum/portal-network-specs/).
- Ability to work independently with mentorship support from senior contributors.

---

## What You’ll Learn

- Deep understanding of Ethereum’s Portal Network architecture.
- How to work with peer-to-peer networking protocols like uTP and discv5.
- Experience writing efficient, verifiable data access code using cryptographic proofs.
- Exposure to light client protocols, SSZ, Merkle trees, and MPTs.
- Mentorship from core developers with contributions to Besu, Portal, and Ethereum infrastructure.
